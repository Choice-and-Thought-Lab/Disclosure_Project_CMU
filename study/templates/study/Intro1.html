{% elif player.role == 'judge' %}
<p> In this study, you will play the role of a neutral judge, and render a judgment.  Please read the instructions very carefully, because it is crucial that you have full information to make a reasoned judgment.  We will be asking some comprehension questions as you go along; you will get paid a bonus (double your base hit) if you answer them all correctly. </p>

<h3>Your Advice</h3>
<p>
    Now it is time for you, as the adviser, to give the estimator advice on the number of solid (filled) dots in the
    30x30 grid, as shown below. The correct number of solid dots in this grid is
    <strong>{{ player.get_correct_answer }}</strong>.
</p>

<p>
    The estimator will attempt to estimate the number of dots in this grid. The estimator will know that the number of
    solid dots can vary from 0 â€“ 900, but the estimator will only be able to see a small 3x3 subset of the grid
    highlighted in yellow below along with the advice that you provide on the communication form below.
</p>

<!-- Actual Grid -->
<div class="container-fluid">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col text-center">
            <img src="/static/{{ group.grid_path }}" />
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

<hr />

<p>Recall that the estimator will get a bigger bonus the more accurate his or her estimate is, and that you will get a
    bigger bonus the more the estimator overestimates the true number of solid dots, as detailed below:</p>

{% include "./PaymentsTable.html" with answer=player.get_correct_answer role=player.role %}

<hr />

<p>Recall that the estimator<strong> will{% if player.disclosure == False %} NOT{% endif %} know</strong> that you
    will be paid bigger bonus the more the estimator overestimates the true number of solid dots:</p>

<p>Please provide your advice to the estimator using the communication form below:</p>

<div align="center" style="border: thin solid black">
    {% include "./CommunicationFormTemplate.html" with player=player group=group disclosure="True" type="actual"%}

    <div class="container-fluid">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-4"></div>
            <div class="col-4 mb-3" align="center">
                {% formfield player.recommendation %}
            </div>
            <div class="col-4"></div>

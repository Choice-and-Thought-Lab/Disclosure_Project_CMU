<h3>Your Payment</h3>
<p>
    In the dots-estimation task, you will be rewarded for the accuracy of your estimate.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>If your estimate is within 10 dots of the correct number</strong>, you will receive a
    {{ Constants.estimator_bonus_within_0_and_10 }} bonus.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>You will receive a smaller bonus the further your estimate is from the correct number.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>If your estimate is off by more than 40</strong>, you will receive no bonus.
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>

    follows:
</p>

{% include "./PaymentsTable.html" with estimate=450 role=player.role %}

<h3>
Estimator's Payment
</h3>
<p>
    <strong> The estimator will be rewarded for the accuracy of his or her estimate of the correct number of solid
    dots in the 30x30 grid that you see. </strong>
</p>
<p>The estimator will receive a {{ Constants.estimator_bonus_within_0_and_10 }} bonus if his or her estimate is within 10 dots of the correct number (either higher or lower). </p>

<p> The estimator will receive a $2.00 bonus if his or her estimate is within 40 dots of the correct number (either higher or lower, but not within 10 dots). </p>

<p>The estimator will receive no bonus if his or her estimate is off by more than 40. </p>

<h3>
Your Payment
</h3>

<p>
    <strong> As the adviser, you will receive a bonus if the estimator provides an estimate that is greater than the correct value. You will receive a bigger bonus the more the estimator overestimates the true number of solid dots.</strong>
</p>

<p> You will receive a $2.00 bonus if the estimator provides an estimate that is more than 10 dots greater than the correct number. </p>
<p>
    You will receive a {{ Constants.adviser_bonus_greater_than_40 }} bonus if the estimator provides an estimate that is more than 40 dots greater than the correct number.

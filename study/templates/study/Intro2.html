  In this study, you will give the estimator advice on the number of
  solid(filled) dots in a 30x30 grid.
</p>
<p>The number of solid dots can vary from 0-900. Below is an example.</p>

{% elif player.role == 'estimator' %}
<p>
  In this study, your adviser will give you advice on the number of
  solid(filled) dots in a 30x30 grid.
</p>
<p>The number of solid dots can vary from 0-900. Below is an example.</p>

{% elif player.role == 'judge' %}

<p>
  Remember, you are playing the role of a neutral judge in this interaction. First, we will introduce to you the
  dots-estimation task involving advisers and estimators. Then, we will provide you with information about an
  interaction between a particular adviser and estimator. Lastly, we will ask
  you to make a judgment about how to allocate bonuses based on the interaction
  between the adviser and estimator.
</p>
<p>
  In this study, advisers were tasked with giving estimators advice on the
  number of solid (filled) dots in a 30x30 grid, as shown below. The number of
  solid dots could vary from 0 – 900.
</p>
<p>
  Below is an example of a 30x30 grid that advisers would see:

  The estimator will attempt to estimate the numer of dots in that grid.
  However, the estimator will only be able to see a small 3x3 subset of the grid
  highlighted in <span style="background-color: yellow">yellow</span> below
  along with your advice. Below is an example.</p>

{% elif player.role == 'estimator' %}
<p>
  You will attempt to estimate the numer of dots in that grid. However, you will
  only be able to see a small 3x3 subset of the grid highlighted in
  <span style="background-color: yellow">yellow</span> below along with the advice you receive from your
  adviser. Below is an example.</p>

{% elif player.role == 'judge' %}
<p>Estimators attempted to estimate the number dots in this grid. However, estimators were only able to see a small 3x3
  subset of the grid highlighted in yellow below along with their advisers’ advice.

{% if player.role == 'judge' %}
<p>
  The dots estimation task had the following compensation scheme:</p>
<p>
  Estimators would get bigger bonuses the more accurate their estimates were.
</p>

<p>For example, suppose the correct number of solid dots were <strong>450</strong>, the estimators' compensation scheme
  was shown as follows:</p>
{% include "./PaymentsTable.html" with answer=450 role='estimator' %}
<hr />
<p>
  Advisers would get bigger bonuses the more estimators overestimated the true number of solid dots.
</p>

<p>For example, suppose the correct number of solid dots were <strong>450</strong>, the advisers' compensation scheme
  was shown as follows:</p>

{% include "./PaymentsTable.html" with answer=450 role=player.role %}

<hr />

<p>Advisers gave advice using an online communication form, like the one shown below.</p>

<p>Note that the advisers' payment scheme <strong>was{% if player.disclosure == False %} NOT{% endif %}
    disclosed</strong>
  to the estimators on the communcation form. That is, estimators <strong>would
    {% if player.disclosure == False %}
    NOT
    {% endif %}
    know</strong> when making their estimates that advisers would be paid a bigger bonus the more estimators
  overestimated the correct number of solid dots.

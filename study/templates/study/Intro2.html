  In this study, you will give the estimator advice on the number of
  solid(filled) dots in a 30x30 grid.
</p>
<p>The number of solid dots can vary from 0-900. Below is an example.</p>

{% elif player.role == 'estimator' %}
<p>
  In this study, your adviser will give you advice on the number of
  solid(filled) dots in a 30x30 grid.
</p>
<p>The number of solid dots can vary from 0-900. Below is an example.</p>

  In another part of the study, participants were paired with one-another, one was assigned the role of estimator and the other to the role of advisor.  They then engaged in a dots-estimation task.   First, we will introduce to you the dots-estimation task. Then, we will provide you with information about an interaction between a particular adviser and estimator. Lastly, we will ask you to make a judgment about how to allocate bonuses based on the interaction between the adviser and estimator.
  In this study, estimators attempted to estimate the number of solid dots in a grid like the 30x30 grid shown below:

<!-- Sample Grid -->
<div class="container-fluid">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col text-center">

{% if player.role == 'adviser' %}
<p>
  The estimator will attempt to estimate the number of dots in that grid.
  However, the estimator will only be able to see a small 3x3 subset of the grid
  highlighted in <span style="background-color: yellow">yellow</span> below
  along with your advice. Below is an example.</p>

  You will attempt to estimate the number of dots in that grid. However, you will

  adviser. Below is an example.</p>

  However, estimators were only able to see a small 3x3 subset of the grid, such as the one highlighted in yellow below:

{% if player.role == 'judge' %}

<p>Advisers were shown the full grid and told the true number of solid dots in the grid.  In the grid shown above, the advisor would know that {{ group.example_grid_path}} of the 900 dots were solid. </p>

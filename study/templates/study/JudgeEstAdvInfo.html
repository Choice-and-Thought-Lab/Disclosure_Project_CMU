<h3> Disclosure of Adviserâ€™s Conflict of Interest</h3> 

<p>Here is the most critical thing for you to know:</p>
<p> <i> <font color="red">  In some cases, the adviser <strong> did NOT disclose </strong>to the estimator that the adviser would be paid more if the estimator overestimated the true number of solid dots. So, the estimator <strong> did NOT know </strong> when making his or her estimate that the adviser would be paid a bonus if the estimator overestimated the correct number of dots.</font> </i></p>
<p> <i> <font color="red"> In other cases, the adviser <strong>DID disclose </strong>  to the estimator that the adviser would be paid more if the estimator overestimated the true number of solid dots. So, the estimator <strong> knew </strong> when making his or her estimate that the adviser would be paid a bonus if the estimator overestimated the correct number of dots.</font></i></p> 

<p>The warning was as follows: </p> 

<div align="center" style="border: thin solid black">
  {% include "./CommunicationFormTemplate.html" with player=player group=group disclosure=True type="example" %}
  <div class="container-fluid">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col text-center mb-3">
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p><strong>Important Disclosure: </strong>I, your adviser, will get a bonus if you <i> overestimate </i>the true number of solid dots. </p>

  <p>So, it is in my interest that you estimate a high number of dots. </p>

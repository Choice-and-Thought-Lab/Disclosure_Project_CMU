<h3>Estimator's Payment</h3>

<p>Estimators were paid based on their accuracy. </p> 

<p>Estimators recieved a bonus of $5.00 if their guess was within 10 of the correct answer. </p>

<p>Estimators recieved a bonus of $2.00 if their guess was within 40 of the correct answer (but not within 10). </p>

<h3>Adviser's Payment </h3>

<p>Advisers had different incentives: advisers were paid to the extent that estimators <i>overestimated the true number of solid dots.  </i> </p> 
<p>Advisers received a bonus of $2.00 if the estimator overestimated the true number of dots by 11-40. </p>
<p>Advisers received a bonus of $5.00 if the estimator overestimated the true number of dots by more than 40.</p>

<p>Here is the most critical thing for you to know:</p>
<p> <i> For some pairs, the estimators did not know that the advisers wanted them to overestimate the number of dots, and the advisers knew that estimators did not know. </i></p>
<p> <i> For other pairs, along with the advice that they gave to estimators, advisers also informed estimators that the adviser would be paid more if the estimator overestimated the true number of solid dots.  The warning was as follows: </i></p>

            <p><strong>Important Disclosure: </strong>I, your adviser, will get a bonus if you <i> overestimate </i>the true number of solid dots. </p>

            <p>So, it is in my interest that you estimate a high number of dots. </p>

<p> The estimator will be rewarded for the accuracy of his or her estimate of the correct number of solid dots in the 30x30 grid that you see.</p>

<p> <strong> If the estimator's estimate is within 10 dots of the correct number, </strong> the estimator will receive a bonus of $5.00 </p>

<p> <strong>The estimator will receive a smaller bonus the further his or her estimate is from the correct number.</strong> </p>

<p> <strong> If the estimator's estimate is off by more than 40,  </strong>he or she will receive no bonus.</p>

<h3>Advisor's Payment </h3>

<p>
  Advisers will get bigger bonuses the more estimators overestimated the true number of solid dots.
</p>

<p>For example, suppose the correct number of solid dots were <strong>450</strong>, the advisers' compensation scheme
  was shown as follows:</p>

{% include "./PaymentsTable.html" with answer=450 role=player.role %}

<hr />

<p>Advisers gave advice using an online communication form, like the one shown below.</p>

<p>Note that the advisers' payment scheme <strong>was{% if player.disclosure == False %} NOT{% endif %}
    disclosed</strong>
  to the estimators on the communcation form. That is, estimators <strong>would
    {% if player.disclosure == False %}
    NOT
    {% endif %}
    know</strong> when making their estimates that advisers would be paid a bigger bonus the more estimators
  overestimated the correct number of solid dots.

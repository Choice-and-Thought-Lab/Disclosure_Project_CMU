<h3>The Case</h3>

<p>
    Now it is time for you, as the judge, to evaluate an interaction between a particular adviser and estimator.
</p>
<p>
    In this case, the adviser saw this 30x30 grid and learned that that correct number of solid dots in this grid was
    <strong>{{ player.get_correct_answer }}</strong>.
</p>

<!-- Actual Grid -->
<div class="container-fluid">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col text-center">
            <img src="/static/{{ group.grid_path }}" />
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

<hr />

<p>
    The adviser advised the estimator that the number of solid dots on the 30x30 grid was
    <strong>{{ player.get_recommendation }}</strong> and communicated this
    advice using the communication form below:
</p>

<div align="center" style="border: thin solid black">
    {% include "./CommunicationFormTemplate.html" with player=player group=group disclosure=False  type="actual"%}
    <div class="container-fluid">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col text-center mb-3">
                <h1><strong>{{ player.get_recommendation }}</strong></h1>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>


<br>

{% if player.disclosure == False %}
<p> In the case of this pair, the adviser’s payment scheme <strong>  was NOT disclosed </strong> to the estimator on the online communication form. That is, the estimator <strong> did NOT know</strong> when making his or her estimates that the adviser would be paid a bonus if the estimator overestimated the correct number of dots. </p>
{% else %}
<p> In the case of this pair, the adviser’s payment scheme <strong>  WAS disclosed </strong> to the estimator on the online communication form. That is, the estimator <strong> knew </strong> when making his or her estimates that the adviser would be paid a bonus if the estimator overestimated the correct number of dots. </p> 
{% endif %}
<br>

<hr />
<br>

<p>The estimator attempted to estimate the number of solid dots in the 30x30 grid. The estimator knew that the number of dots could vary from 0 – 900, but they were only able to see the small 3x3 subset of the grid highlighted in yellow along with the advice that the adviser provided on the communication form above.</p>

<p>Based on the small grid they saw and the adviser’s recommendation, the estimator provided an estimate of <strong
        style="font-size: large;">{{ player.get_estimate }}</strong>. </p>

<p> This estimate is {{ player.number_off }} above the true number, {{ player.group.correct_answer }}, that the advisor knew. </p> 


<p>
    As a result, the adviser earned a bonus of <strong>{{ player.matched_adviser.grid_reward }}</strong>, and the
    estimator earned
    <strong>{{ player.matched_estimator.grid_reward }}</strong>.

</p>

<h3>Your Judgment</h3>
<p>
    Now, we’d like you to make a decision about allocating bonuses.

</p>
<p>
    The adviser and the estimator are both eligible to receive additional bonuses for participating. There is
    {{ Constants.appeal_reward }} to be split between the adviser and the estimator.

</p>
<p>It is your job, as the judge, to decide how to split the money. You should make this decision based on whether you
    think the estimator was treated unfairly by the adviser during the dots-estimation task.</p>
   
<p> When making your judgment, please recall that the advisor<strong> was {% if not player.disclosure %} not {% endif %} informed </strong>that the estimator would receive a larger bonus if he/she overestimated the correct number of solid dots.</p>


<p>If you think that the estimator was treated unfairly, you should award $2.00 to the estimator and $0.00 to the
    adviser.</p>
<p>If you think that the estimator was treated fairly, you should award the estimator and adviser $1.00 apiece.</p>

<br>
<p>
    <strong>To summarize:</strong>

    <ul>
        <li>The correct number of solid dots was <strong>{{ player.get_correct_answer }}</strong>.</li>
        <li>The adviser told the estimator there were <strong>{{ player.get_recommendation }}</strong> solid dots, and
            the estimator <strong>was{% if player.disclosure == False %} NOT{% endif %} informed</strong> that the
            adviser would get a bigger bonus if the estimator overestimated.</li>
        <li>The estimator estimated there were <strong>{{ player.get_estimate }}</strong> solid dots. </li>
        <li>As a result, the adviser earned a bonus of <strong>{{ player.matched_adviser.grid_reward }}</strong>, and
            the estimator earned
            <strong>{{ player.matched_estimator.grid_reward }}</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

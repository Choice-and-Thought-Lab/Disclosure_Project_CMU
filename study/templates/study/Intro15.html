<p> In this study, there are two roles: Adviser and Estimator.  You have been randomly assigned to play the role of adviser. You have been paired with another MTurker who will play the role of estimator. You will give advice to the estimator, who will make a decision that will determine both of your bonuses.</p> 

<p>In the course of the experiment, you will be asked some basic comprehension questions.  You will not be eligible for any bonuses you answer any of these questions incorrectly. So, please pay close attention.</p>

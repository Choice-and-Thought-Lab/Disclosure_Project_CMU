<h3>Additional Bonus</h3>
<p>
    We now have some additional information for you.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>You and the advisor are both going to receive additional bonuses for participating.</strong> There is
    {{ Constants.appeal_reward }} to be split evenly between yourself and the advisor, for
    {{ Constants.appeal_reward_split }} apiece.
</p>

<h3>Opportunity to send your case to a Third-Party judge</h3>
<p>
    You now have the opportunity to <strong>send your case to a third-party judge</strong>, who will review what
    happened to you in the dots estimation task. If you choose this option, the judge will determine whether you
    were treated unfairly by your advisor in the dots-estimation task.
</p>

<p>It will cost you {{ Constants.appeal_cost }} to send your case to the judge. You will pay this fee <strong>regardless
        of whether or not you win</strong>
</p>

<h3>How judge will decide your case</h3>
<p>
    <strong>If you send the case and the judge decides you were treated unfairly</strong>, you will pay
    {{ Constants.appeal_cost }} and receive {{ Constants.appeal_reward }}, while your advisor will receive no bonus.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>If you send the case and the judge decides you were treated fairly</strong>, you will pay
    {{ Constants.appeal_cost }}. Both you and your advisor will receive {{ Constants.appeal_reward_split }}.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>If you decide not to send the case</strong> you and your advisor will each receive
    {{ Constants.appeal_reward_split }}.

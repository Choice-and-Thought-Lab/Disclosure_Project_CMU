<p>
    We now have some additional information for you.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>You and the adviser are both going to receive additional bonuses for participating.</strong> There is
    <strong>{{ Constants.appeal_reward }}</strong> to be split evenly between you and the adviser.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Opportunity to file an appeal</h3>

<p> If you do nothing, then the {{ Constants.appeal_reward }} will be split evenly between you and the adviser.  However, you may file an appeal to keep 100% of the <strong>{{ Constants.appeal_reward }}</strong> bonus if you think that your adviser treated you unfairly in the dots-estimation task.</p>


<p>If you file an appeal, a third-party judge will review what happened to you in the dots-estimation task and determine whether you were treated unfairly by your adviser.</p>

<p>It will cost you <strong>{{ Constants.appeal_cost }}</strong> to file an appeal with a judge. This will come out of your {{ Constants.appeal_reward_split }} if you lose the appeal. You will not pay this fee, however, if you win the appeal.</p>

<hr />

<h3>This is how the judge will decide your case</h3>
<p>
    If you choose to file an appeal, the judge will see that your adviser told you there were <strong>{{ player.get_recommendation }}</strong> dots.
</p>

<p>
    The judge will know that the correct number of dots is <strong>{{ player.get_correct_answer }}</strong>. The judge will also see that you estimated there were <strong>{{ player.get_estimate }}</strong> dots.
</p>
<p> 
The judge will know about your payoffs and your adviserâ€™s payoffs that were based on your estimate. The judge will see how much both you and your adviser earned.
</p>
{% if player.disclosure == True %}
<p> <strong> The judge will also know that your adviser informed you that they would benefit if you overestimated the true number of solid dots. </strong> </p> 
{% else %}
<p> <strong> The judge will also know that your adviser did not inform you that they would benefit if you overestimated the true number of solid dots. </strong> </p> 
{% endif %}
<p><strong>
        The judge will then make a decision about whether you are entitled to 100% of the {{ Constants.appeal_reward }} bonus or whether it should be split evenly between you and your adviser.
</strong></p>

<hr />

<p>
    <strong>If you file an appeal and the judge decides you were treated unfairly</strong>, you will receive <strong>{{ Constants.appeal_reward }}</strong>, while your adviser will receive no bonus.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>If you file an appeal and the judge decides you were treated fairly</strong>, you will pay <strong>{{ Constants.appeal_cost }}</strong>. Both you and your adviser will receive <strong>{{ Constants.appeal_reward_split }}</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>If you decide not to file an appeal</strong>, you and your adviser will each receive <strong>{{ Constants.appeal_reward_split }}</strong>.

<h3>Additional bonus</h3>
<p>
    We now have some additional information for you.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>You and the adviser are both going to receive additional bonuses for participating.</strong> There is
    <strong>{{ Constants.appeal_reward }}</strong> to be split evenly between yourself and the adviser, for
    <strong>{{ Constants.appeal_reward_split }}</strong> apiece.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Opportunity to file an appeal</h3>

<p>You may file an appeal to keep 100% of the <strong>{{ Constants.appeal_reward }}</strong> bonus if you think that
    your adviser treated you unfairly in the dots-estimation task.</p>


<p>
    If you file an appeal, a third-party judge will review what
    happened to you in the dots-estimation task and determine whether you
    were treated unfairly by your adviser.
</p>

<p>It will cost you <strong>{{ Constants.appeal_cost }}</strong> to file an appeal with a judge. You will pay this fee
    <strong>regardless
        of whether or not you win the appeal.</strong>
</p>

<hr />

<h3>How the judge will decide your case</h3>
<p>
    If you choose to file an appeal, the judge will see that your adviser told you there were
    <strong>{{ player.get_recommendation }}</strong> dots and
    that you <strong>were {% if player.disclosure == False %}NOT {% endif %}informed</strong> that your adviser stood to
    benefit financially if you overestimated.
</p>
<p>
    The judge will know that the correct number of dots is <strong>{{ player.get_correct_answer }}</strong>. The judge
    will also see that
    you estimated there were <strong>{{ player.get_estimate }}</strong> dots. The judge will see how much both you and
    your adviser earned.
</p>
<p><strong>
        The judge will then make a decision about whether you are entitled to 100% of the
        {{ Constants.appeal_reward }} bonus or whether it should be split evenly between you and your adviser.
    </strong></p>

<hr />

<p>
    <strong>If you file an appeal and the judge decides you were treated unfairly</strong>, you will pay
    <strong>{{ Constants.appeal_cost }}</strong> and receive <strong>{{ Constants.appeal_reward }}</strong>, while your
    adviser will receive no bonus.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>If you file an appeal and the judge decides you were treated fairly</strong>, you will pay
    <strong>{{ Constants.appeal_cost }}</strong>. Both you and your adviser will receive
    <strong>{{ Constants.appeal_reward_split }}</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>If you decide not to file an appeal</strong>, you and your adviser will each receive
    <strong>{{ Constants.appeal_reward_split }}</strong>.

<h3>Your Judgment</h3>

<p>
  Now, weâ€™d like you to make a decision about allocating bonuses.
</p>
<p>
    The adviser and the estimator are both eligible to receive additional bonuses for participating. There is
    {{ Constants.appeal_reward }} to be split between the adviser and the estimator.

</p>
<p>It is your job, as the judge, to decide how to split the money. You should make this decision based on whether you
    think the estimator was treated unfairly by the adviser during the dots-estimation task.</p>
   
<p> When making your judgment, please recall that the adviser<strong> was {% if not player.disclosure %} not {% endif %} informed </strong>that the estimator would receive a larger bonus if he/she overestimated the correct number of solid dots.</p>


<p>If you think that the estimator was treated unfairly, you should award $2.00 to the estimator and $0.00 to the
    adviser.</p>
<p>If you think that the estimator was treated fairly, you should award the estimator and adviser $1.00 apiece.</p>

<br>
<p>
    <strong>To summarize:</strong>

    <ul>
        <li>The correct number of solid dots was <strong>{{ player.get_correct_answer }}</strong>.</li>
        <li>The adviser told the estimator there were <strong>{{ player.get_recommendation }}</strong> solid dots, and
            the advisor <strong>did {% if player.disclosure == False %} NOT{% endif %} inform </strong> the estimator that the
            adviser would get a bigger bonus if the estimator overestimated.</li>
        <li>The estimator estimated there were <strong>{{ player.get_estimate }}</strong> solid dots. </li>
        <li>As a result, the adviser earned a bonus of <strong>{{ player.matched_adviser.grid_reward }}</strong>, and
            the estimator earned
            <strong>{{ player.matched_estimator.grid_reward }}</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    If you choose to send your case, the judge will see that your advisor told you there were <strong>{{ player.get_recommendation }}</strong> dots and 
    that you were {% if player.disclosure == False %}not {% endif %}informed that your advisor stood to benefit 
    financially if you overestimated.
    </p>
    <p>
    The judge will know that the correct number of dots is {{ player.get_correct_answer }}. The judge will also see that 
    you estimated there were <strong>{{ player.estimate }}</strong> dots. The judge will see how much both you and 
    your advisor earned.
    </p>
    <p><strong>
    The judge will then make a decision about whether you are entitled to 100% of the 
    {{ Constants.appeal_reward }} bonus or whether it should be split evenly between you and your advisor.

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<p>
  Advisers gave advice to estimators, in the form: 
</p>

<div align="center" style="border: thin solid black">
  {% include "./CommunicationFormTemplate.html" with player=player group=group disclosure=False type="example" %}
  <div class="container-fluid">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col text-center mb-3">
        {% comment %} <h1><strong>542</strong></h1> {% endcomment %}
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  {% if player.disclosure == True %}

   <p><strong>Important Disclosure: </strong>I, your adviser, will get a bonus if you <i> overestimate </i>the true number of solid dots. </p>

   <p>So, it is in my interest that you estimate a high number of dots. </p> 

  {% endif %}
</div>
<br/>
<p>
  where "---" is the number the adviser specified.  Estimators received this advice before they made their estimate.
</p>
<hr/>

<h3 style="margin: 1em 0 0.5em 0;">Estimator's Payment</h3>

<p><strong>Estimators were rewarded for the accuracy of their estimates of the correct number of solid dots in the 30x30 grid. </strong></p>
<p>Estimators received a $5.00 bonus if their estimates were within 10 dots of the correct number (either higher or lower). </p>
<p>Estimator received a $2.00 bonus if their estimate was within 40 dots of the correct number (either higher or lower, but not within 10 dots). </p>
<p>Estimator received no bonus if their estimate was off by more than 40.</p>
<hr/>

<h3 style="margin: 1em 0 0.5em 0;">Adviser's Payment </h3>

<p><strong>Unbeknownst to estimators, advisers had different incentives:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Advisers received a bonus if the estimator provided an estimate that was greater than the correct value. Advisers received a bigger bonus the more the estimator overestimated the true number of solid dots.</strong></p>
<p>Advisers received a $2.00 bonus if the estimator provided an estimate that was more than 10 dots greater than the correct number. </p>
<p>Advisers received a $5.00 bonus if the estimator provided an estimate that was more than 40 dots greater than the correct number. </p>
<p>Otherwise, advisers did not receive a bonus. </p>

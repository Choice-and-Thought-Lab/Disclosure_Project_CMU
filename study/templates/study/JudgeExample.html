<h3>Instructions</h3>

<p>
  Advisers gave advice to estimators, in the form: 
</p>

<div align="center" style="border: thin solid black">
  {% include "./CommunicationFormTemplate.html" with player=player group=group disclosure=False type="example" %}
  <div class="container-fluid">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col text-center mb-3">
        {% comment %} <h1><strong>542</strong></h1> {% endcomment %}
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  {% if player.disclosure == True %}

   <p><strong>Important Disclosure: </strong>I, your adviser, will get a bonus if you <i> overestimate </i>the true number of solid dots. </p>

   <p>So, it is in my interest that you estimate a high number of dots. </p> 

  {% endif %}
</div>
<hr />

<p>
  where "---" is the number the adviser specified.  Estimators received this advice before they made their estimate.
</p>


<h3>Estimator's Payment</h3>

<p>Estimators were paid based on their accuracy.  If the estimatorâ€™s guess was within 10 of the correct answer, he or she would earn a bonus of $5.00.</p> 

<p>The estimator could earn a smaller bonus - $2.00 - if his or her guess was within 40 of the correct answer (but not within 10). </p>

<h3>Adviser's Payment </h3>

<p>Advisers had different incentives: Advisers were paid to the extent that estimators <i>overestimated the true number of solid dots.  </i> </p> 
<p>Advisers received a bonus of $2.00 if the estimator overestimated the true number of dots by 11-40. </p>
<p>Advisers received a bonus of $5.00 if the estimator overestimated the true number of dots by more than 40.</p>

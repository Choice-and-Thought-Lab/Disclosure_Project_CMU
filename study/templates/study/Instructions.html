<p>    Recall that you are the adviser.    </p> 
<p>The judgment that the estimator will make is to estimate the number of solid (filled) dots in a 30x30 grid.</p>
<p>The number of solid dots can vary from 0-900. Below is an example.</p>

<p> In another part of the study, participants were paired with one another. One person was assigned the role of estimator and the other to the role of adviser.  They then engaged in a dots-estimation task. </p> 
<p> First, we will introduce to you the dots-estimation task. Then, we will provide you with information about an interaction between a particular adviser and estimator. Last, we will ask you to make a judgment about how to allocate bonuses based on the interaction between the adviser and estimator. </p>

<p> The estimator will attempt to estimate the number of dots in that grid and will be rewarded based on how close his/her estimate is to the actual number of solid dots. However, the estimator will only be able to see a small 3x3 subset of the grid highlighted in yellow below
 along with your advice. Below is an example of the small grid that the estimator will see along with your advice. </p>

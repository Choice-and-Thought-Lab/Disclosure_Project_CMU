<h3>Your Payment</h3>


<p>Your adviser advised you that there were <strong>{{ player.get_recommendation }}</strong> solid dots.</p>

<p>
    You guessed that there were <strong>{{ player.get_estimate }}</strong> solid dots.
</p>
<p>
    The correct number was <strong>{{ player.get_correct_answer }}</strong>. The full grid is shown below:
</p>

<!-- Actual Grid -->
<div class="container-fluid">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col text-center">
            <img src="/static/{{ group.grid_path }}" />
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

<p>As a result, you earned a bonus of <strong>{{ player.matched_estimator.grid_reward }}</strong></p>

<p>Your adviser earned a bonus of <strong>{{ player.matched_adviser.grid_reward }}</strong>.</p>

{% include "./PaymentsTable.html" with answer=player.get_correct_answer role='adviser' %}

<hr />

<p>Note that your adviser earned a bigger bonus the more you overestimated the true number of solid dots.</p>

<p>
    As you may recall, the adviser <strong>did{% if player.disclosure == False %} NOT{% endif %} notify you</strong>
    about his or her conflict of interest before you made your estimate.
